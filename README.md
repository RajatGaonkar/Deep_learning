# Deep Learning Projects
## 1.BERT
In this project I have implemented BERT pretrained model using tensorflow and transformer library on commonlit readability kaggle dataset to predict
reading ease or complexity with a loss of 0.32 and validation loss of 0.67. [link](https://youtu.be/UirtGMGKXjA) for project explaination.

## 2.disease_classifier
In this project DNN model with convolution layer is built to classify disease and disease free arecanut with a training accuracy of 98 and validation accuracy of 50 the model is overfit due to less data. Im still working on the project

## 3. Voice Assistant 
This is a simple voice assistant which uses google api to interconvert text and speech to take commands and deliver the information. Through this we can hear a short information about anything from wikipedia and also we can control music, get time and date know the system status. also we can shutdown or restart the system only using voice commands

## 4. Arecanut Disease Classifier
