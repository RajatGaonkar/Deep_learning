# Deep Learning Projects
## 1.BERT
In this project I have implemented BERT pretrained model using tensorflow and transformer library on commonlit readability kaggle dataset to predict
reading ease or complexity with a loss of 0.32 and validation loss of 0.67. [link](https://youtu.be/UirtGMGKXjA) for project explaination.

## 2.disease_classifier
In this project DNN model with convolution layer is built to classify disease and disease free arecanut with a training accuracy of 98 and validation accuracy of 50 the model is overfit due to less data. Im still working on the project
